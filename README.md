# Green IT - Dynamic Network Topologies
## Overview
The files contained in this repository are designed to test the implementation of a dynamic topology mechanism that performs the following:
	* Based on overall network traffic, selects nodes to place into a standby state
	* In the standby state, each node maintains one connection to a node in the active state, but shuts down all other connections. The intent is to make no routing decisions and reduce power consumption; all non-local traffic is forwarded from the standby node to the active node
The “Dissertation.pdf” document provides a full explanation of the research, development, and implementation of this project.

## Operation
There are three components in the dynamic topology mechanism:

* A centralized controller

* A collection of network nodes

* The host devices connected to the network nodes

These entities interact in the following loop:

1. Nodes: Send network traffic information to Controller

2. Controller: Analyze network traffic matrix and determine optimal topology

    * Focus on energy consumption reduction through the use of node standby states
    
    * Ensure link utilisation does not rise above a threshold value for any of the links
    
    * Apply optimisation heuristics

3. Controller/Nodes: Send/fetch the topology change information

4. Nodes: Implement the topology change

5. Repeat

For testing purposes, each network node contains a virtual machine that generates traffic to simulate a locally connected network. The full logical topology, including the virtual hosts running on each node and the centralized controller, is shown below:

The inter-node traffic generated by the hosts is designed to be classified as low, medium, or high load, and the controller correspondingly selects one of the three topologies shown below:
